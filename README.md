# News Web App
This News Reader Website is made using Next Js, Node Js, Tailwind CSS and Firbase. It contains Authentication and Sign Up Functionality and displays the latest news fetched from `https://newsapi.org/` It also let's you add your favourite news and stores it so that you can read it the next time you login.

## This has been deployed on Vercel but the News API only allows to fetch information from it on the local machine and hence that is why it is not fetching News articles on the Vercel deployed link.
